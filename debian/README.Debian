Firejail for Debian
===================

Firejail is intended to sandbox/restrict other applications.
To achieve this, it utilizes Linux namespaces, which require
root privileges. Because of this, the setuid bit of the binary
has to be set.

To allow only users being part of a certain group to run firejail,
dpkg-statoverride(1) can be used to modify the permissions.

Example:
 # dpkg-statoverride --update --add root users 4754 /usr/bin/firejail
